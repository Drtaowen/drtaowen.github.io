  Looking for potential PhD positions-->

<h2>About me</h2>


<p>I am currently a MEng (Research) student in the <a href="https://smt.sutd.edu.sg/">Science, Mathematics and Technology Cluster</a> at <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/">Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)</a>, Singapore, supervised by <a href="https://kanghaocheong.com/">Prof. Kang Hao Cheong</a>. I received my B.Eng. degree in Detection, Gudiance and Control Technology from <a href="http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/">Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU)</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://dianzi.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1290/8224.htm">Prof. Wen Jiang</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8voeILsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Prof. Yong Deng</a> in 2019. During my undergraduate research, I was a research assistant at the <a href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn/">University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8voeILsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Prof. Yong Deng</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Research interests</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Complex network properties exploring by fractal property and entropy. </p>
</li>
  <ul>
  <li type = "circle"><p>Network Properties: Combined Fuzzy theory and fractal dimension to evaluate the vulnerability of networks, which can describe nodes&#39 relationships more precise; Considered the local structure property and whole structure property through Tsallis entropy to measure the complexity of networks. </p>
  </li>
  <li type = "circle"><p>Node Properties: Proposed several novel dimensions of nodes to identify influential individuals in the network; Modified the classical Kullback-Leibler divergence to consider more properties in network to find the pair of similar nodes. </p>
  </li>
  <li type = "circle"><p>Community Properties: Combined the internal factors and external factors of community to measure the vulnerability of each community via the entropy-based method; Proposed the gravity-based model to describe the large-scale interaction relationship between communities to further improve the quantification and identification ability of the vulnerability of communities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
  
<li><p>Grope decision making based on game theory and network theory. </p>
</li>
  <ul>
  <li type = "circle"><p>Collected the personal opinion of each expert by 2-order additive fuzzy measure, and identified the most important expert after constructing the expert network based on their relationships, thereby solving group decision-making problems without sufficient information. </p>
  </li>
  </ul>

<li><p>Parrondo’s paradox phenomenon in interdisciplinary research. </p>
</li>
  <ul>
  <li type = "circle"><p>Explored the economic and health cost caused by different strategies (open community & lockdown) under the epidemic of COVID, and obtained the winning result when taking alternating two losing strategies based on time-based and result-based switching scheme. </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
