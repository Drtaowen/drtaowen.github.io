</ul>

<h2>Research interests</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Complex network properties exploring by fractal property and entropy. </p>
</li>
  <ul>
  <li type = "circle"><p>Network Properties: Combined Fuzzy theory and fractal dimension to evaluate the vulnerability of networks, which can describe nodes&#39 relationships more precise; Considered the local structure property and whole structure property through Tsallis entropy to measure the complexity of networks. </p>
  </li>
  <li type = "circle"><p>Node Properties: Proposed several novel dimensions of nodes to identify influential individuals in the network; Modified the classical Kullback-Leibler divergence to consider more properties in network to find the pair of similar nodes. </p>
  </li>
  <li type = "circle"><p>Community Properties: Combined the internal factors and external factors of community to measure the vulnerability of each community via the entropy-based method; Proposed the gravity-based model to describe the large-scale interaction relationship between communities to further improve the quantification and identification ability of the vulnerability of communities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
  
<li><p>Grope decision making based on game theory and network theory. </p>
</li>
  <ul>
  <li type = "circle"><p>Collected the personal opinion of each expert by 2-order additive fuzzy measure, and identified the most important expert after constructing the expert network based on their relationships, thereby solving group decision-making problems without sufficient information. </p>
  </li>
  </ul>

<li><p>Parrondo’s paradox phenomenon in interdisciplinary research. </p>
</li>
  <ul>
  <li type = "circle"><p>Explored the economic and health cost caused by different strategies (open community & lockdown) under the epidemic of COVID, and obtained the winning result when taking alternating two losing strategies based on time-based and result-based switching scheme. </p>
  </li>
  <li type = "circle"><p>Proposed different nonlinear dynamic evolution model of competition between several populations, such as host-parasite and prey-predator system, and found that the disadvantaged population can win the competition by switching between two losing strategies, a counter-intuitive result caused by Parrondo’s paradox. </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
